Blog for Flatiron
Hello World!
My name is Clay Hunn and I am currently in the Flatiron Data Science program, this will serve as my first blog for the course as well as an introduction to me and why I decided to take this program.  My main goal with taking this course is drum roll….. you guessed it, a better career! What a surprise.  Although, I do think I have a deeper motivation and interest behind that initial goal. 

I’ll be honest with you; my professional career is a bit of a roller coaster.  I have spent multiple years in multiple industries, with about 2 years in each of the following industries: oil and gas land work, ran my own crypto mining company, and most recently mortgage banking.  Ideally, I would like to branch out to fintech/economics but feel I can contribute in any of my previous industries.  

A big motivation for me in attending this course is to learn the skillset required to run my own stock/option trading algorithms and I can already get a sense that the data visualization and flexibility of python can contribute to that process.  I am very excited to get to the machine learning portions of this course and see what tools I will have at my disposal.

A dream position for me after this program would be with a trading firm or financial company, where I can learn best practices and get more hands on experience in the space I want to advance my career in.
